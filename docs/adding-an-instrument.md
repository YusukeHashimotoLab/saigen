# Adding a new instrument

This guide walks through adding an instrument that the flow executor can drive,
using a digital multimeter (DMM) as the running example. The same steps apply to
any instrument that does not belong to a particular robot arm: a pH meter, a
spectrometer, a second balance. Instruments mounted on an arm (a second pipette,
a gripper) go through `LabRobot` instead of `SharedDevices`; the layering is the
same, only the class differs.

The electronic balance is the closest existing example, and every step below
names the balance code to copy from. Read `src/devices/README.md` first for the
two-layer design (thin drivers, one safety wrapper).

## 0. Decide where it belongs

| Question | Answer for a DMM | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Is it attached to one robot arm? | No, it sits on the bench | Shared device: actions carry no `robot_id`, implemented in `SharedDevices` |
| Does a step produce a value worth recording? | Yes, a voltage | The step returns a result dict and the run log gets a new column |
| Does it move anything or dispense anything? | No | No workspace validation needed; nothing in `src/devices/safety/validators/` changes |

If the probe has to be positioned by the arm, keep the *measurement* a shared-device
action and express the positioning as ordinary `move_xyz` / `move_z` steps in the
flow. Do not add motion to a shared device.

## 1. Driver: `src/devices/<instrument>/`

Create `src/devices/dmm/` with `__init__.py`, a driver module and a short README
(command set, wiring, one usage example).

- Copy the shape of `SerialBalance` in `src/devices/scale/BCE8221.py`: a class that
  opens the connection in `__init__`, exposes a few instrument-level methods
  (`read_voltage()`, `read_current()`, ...) and a `close()`.
- The driver knows nothing about experiments, flows or robots.
- Every address (COM port, VISA resource string, Bluetooth address) is a
  constructor argument with a placeholder default. Never hard-code a real one.
- Use the protocol the instrument speaks. Most bench DMMs (Keysight, Keithley,
  Rigol) accept SCPI, e.g. `MEAS:VOLT:DC?`, over USB-TMC (`pyvisa`) or RS-232C /
  USB-CDC (`pyserial`). Add the library to `requirements.txt`, and if it is
  heavy or platform-specific, import it inside the driver module, not at package
  level, so the mock path never needs it (the balance does this with `serial`).
- Parse the reply into a `float` and return `None` when the reply is not a
  number, as `SerialBalance.get_weight()` does; the wrapper decides what to do
  with `None`.

## 2. Safety wrapper: `src/devices/safety/shared_devices.py`

Add the instrument to `SharedDevices` following the balance:

1. A `use_dmm: bool = False` constructor flag and `self.dmm = None`.
2. A settle time read from `device_configs` (`wait_after_dmm`, like `wait_after_scale`).
3. `_initialize_dmm()`: import the driver lazily, construct it from
   `device_configs['dmm_port']`, take one reading to prove the link, return
   `False` (with a logged error) on failure. Call it from `initialize()` when
   the flag is set.
4. The public async method the executor will call, e.g.
   `async def measure_voltage(self, samples: int = 3) -> float`. Take several
   readings and return the median, as `measure_weight()` does, then sleep the
   settle time. Raise, do not return `None`, when the instrument gives nothing
   usable; the executor records the exception per step.
5. Close the driver in `cleanup()`.

Do not touch `src/devices/safety/validators/` or the `workspace` section of
`config.yaml`; a measuring instrument has no business there.

## 3. Mock: `src/devices/safety/mock_robot.py`

`MockSharedDevices` must accept the same constructor flag and expose the same
method with the same signature. Return a fixed, plausible value
(`MOCK_VOLTAGE = 1.234`, next to `MOCK_WEIGHT`), never `None`: the mock run is
what tests, CI and `--mock` use to check that the value reaches the log.

## 4. Flow schema and executor

`src/flow/schema.py`

- Copy `ActionMeasureWeight` to `ActionMeasureVoltage` with
  `action: Literal["measure_voltage"]` and bounded parameters
  (`samples: int = Field(3, ge=1, le=10)`, range or function if the instrument
  needs them). Use `Field` bounds; they are the only validation a flow gets
  before it runs.
- Add the class to the `LabRobotAction` union. Only listed classes are valid steps.

`src/flow/executor.py`

- Add `"measure_voltage"` to `SHARED_DEVICE_ACTIONS` so the step is routed to
  the shared devices and is accepted without a `robot_id`.
- Add a branch in `execute_shared_device_step()` that reads the parameters from
  either a dict or the model (both forms reach it), calls the wrapper and
  returns `{"voltage": value}`.
- In `plan_resources()` (`src/flow/run_flow.py`), derive `needs_dmm` from the
  actions present in the flow, next to `needs_scale` and `needs_camera`, return
  it with the other flags, and pass `use_dmm=needs_dmm` through
  `ExperimentSession.add_shared()` (`src/flow/experiment_session.py`, whose
  shared-device factories forward it to `SharedDevices` / `MockSharedDevices`).
  The CSV runner and the GUI runner unpack the same tuple, so update those two
  call sites as well. This is what lets a flow that never measures voltage run
  on a cell without a DMM.

`src/flow/experiment_logger.py`

- `record_step()` currently knows two result keys, `weight` and `image_path`,
  and writes them as the `weight_g` and `image_path` columns of `measurements.csv`.
  Add the new key the same way (`voltage_v`), and add the event kind to the
  time-line report if the value is worth listing there. If you expect more
  instruments, this is the moment to generalise to `measurement` / `unit`
  columns instead of one column per quantity.

## 5. Configuration

- `src/config.py`: add `dmm_port` to the `shared_devices` defaults.
- `config.example.yaml`: add the same key with a comment. `config.yaml` is
  gitignored; users copy the example.
- Optional: a `--dmm-port` argument and `DMM_PORT` environment variable in
  `src/flow/run_flow.py`, mirroring `--scale-port` / `SCALE_PORT`, so a port can
  be overridden per run without editing the file.

## 6. Tests

All tests run without hardware.

- Driver parsing: copy `tests/test_wp2_balance_sign.py`. Stub the serial or
  VISA module, build the driver with `object.__new__`, and check that the
  instrument's real reply strings (copy them from the manual or a terminal
  session) parse to the right number and that garbage gives `None`.
- End to end: add a flow containing `measure_voltage` to the mock-run test in
  `tests/test_run_flow.py` and assert that `measurements.csv` has the value in the new
  column. This catches a missing union entry, a missing action in
  `SHARED_DEVICE_ACTIONS`, and a mock that returns `None`.
- Run the full check before reporting done:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ src/monitoring/tests/ -q
python -m src.flow.run_flow <your flow>.json --validate-only
python -m src.flow.run_flow <your flow>.json --mock
```

## 7. GUI (optional): `src/gui/app.py`

The steps above make the action usable from JSON flows, the CSV runner and the
flow-generating agent. The Streamlit GUI has its own block palette and needs
three more edits, all in `src/gui/app.py`, only if users should be able to add
the step from the GUI:

- `ACTION_CONFIG`: an entry keyed by the action name with an icon, a Japanese
  label and the default parameters, e.g.
  `"measure_voltage": {"icon": "🔋", "label": "電圧測定", "category": "sensor", "defaults": {"samples": 3}}`.
- `CATEGORIES`: add the action name to the list of the group it should appear
  under in the toolbox (`"sensor"` for the balance and camera).
- `get_param_summary()` and `render_step_params()`: one `elif action == ...`
  branch in each, the first returning a one-line summary of the parameters,
  the second drawing the input widgets (copy the `measure_weight` branches).

The GUI imports `SHARED_DEVICE_ACTIONS` from the executor, so a step whose
action is in that set is created without a `robot_id` automatically. Validation
and the Mock run in the GUI go through the same schema and executor as the CLI,
so nothing else is needed. Verify with `streamlit run src/gui/app.py`: add the
block, check the parameters, run *Mock*.

## 8. Documentation

- `docs/experimental-flow.md`: one row in the *Shared devices* table.
- `src/devices/README.md`: one row in the driver table and the method in the
  `SharedDevices` row.
- `docs/bom.md`: the instrument, with model and interface.
- `docs/setup.md`: how to connect it and find its port.
- `src/agent/llm_service.py`: the action list given to the flow-generating
  LLM. Add the action there if the agent should be able to use it; leave it out
  if it should not.

## What not to do

- Do not make the executor call a driver directly. Every instrument goes
  through `SharedDevices` or `LabRobot`, so that the mock, the logging and the
  emergency stop cover it.
- Do not put a lab's port names, IP addresses or Bluetooth addresses in
  defaults, examples or tests.
- Do not add an instrument whose driver depends on an AGPL package under
  `src/`; `detection/` is kept separate for that reason.
